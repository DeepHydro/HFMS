## Description
  Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) cause environmental problems worldwide. Continuous monitoring and forecasting of harmful algal blooms are necessary for marine resources managers to detect the intensity and spatial extent of HABs and provide early warnings to the public. The Harmful Algal Blooms Monitoring and Forecasting System (HMFS) integrates in situ observations, a remote-sensing-based model, hydrodynamic and water quality model and Web-Based Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques into one environment.
